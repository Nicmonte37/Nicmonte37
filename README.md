## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at Stonehill College as a Chemistry Lab Manager. Before working in the education, I was working on conservation projects. A few of the projects I have worked on have been beach renourishment, estuary water quality, and working with Northern Right Whales. Inaddition to working at Stonehill College, I am a Conservation Commissioner for the Town of Franklin, Ma. This position allows me to participate in the feild I love and to be a part of the governing process of conservation. I really miss working in Marine conservation but it is satisfying to be able to work to conserve the environment in which I live in.
